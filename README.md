
# Football Analytics with Deep Learning and Computer Vision

**Project goal:** Create a web application to automate football analysis, and provide useful information that helps in decision making.


**Current stage:** Developing a streamlit web application for football object detection with tactical map representation.



## Installation & How to use?

Steps:
1. Clone the repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/Hmzbo/Football-Analytics-with-Deep-Learning-and-Computer-Vision.git `
2. Install the required libraries listed in the file `requirement.txt`, you can use the command `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the conda env I use but make sure the pytorch installation is compatible with your machine.
3. Use the command `steamlit run main.py` to start the application.
    
## Features

- Detect players, referees and ball.
- Predict players teams based on predefined team colors.
- Build a tactical map representation.
- Track ball movements.
